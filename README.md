# Hubitat-BetterLaundryMonitor

<p>Ported Kevin Tierney's SmartThings DTH to Hubitat Driver by @ChrisUthe.
<br>Converted to Parent-Child App by cSteele.
<br>Added @CobraVmax version check.
<br>Miscellaneous Enhancements by Barry Burke.
<br>Added readability to Parent and Child Apps and incorporated xxKeoxx's Child name/rename request.
<p>Copy the 'raw' source files into Hubitat, parent then child. 
<br>Add New User App and pick the Parent code. (Child will be found by parent)
<br>Open the App and build as many child apps as are needed, one for each washer or dryer.
